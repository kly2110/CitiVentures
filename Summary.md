# Citi Ventures Disruptive Innovation Challenge

## Brief Summary
Proposed an innovative and technical solution to address major macroeconomic trends in the workforce. Designed a comprehensive system for helping professionals navigate their way to meaningful work.

## Topic
Apart from the challenge of choosing WHAT type of work to pursue with one’s career, the second major challenge is WHERE to do it. 2018 graduates will be presented with opportunities not only in professional work, but also in where to conduct their work. 

## Challenge
Create a tool that will help match professionals interested in a given field with a list of the best places (e.g. cities, neighborhoods, etc.) for them to do that work. Due to time constraints, choose a set number of careers or job titles to target (25 jobs at most).  An ideal product will identify criteria that make cities attractive for workers in a particular industry, rank cities by those criteria, and present a framework where these results can be presented to individual workers or municipal partners for future planning.

We proposed a comprehensive and holistic tool, nicknamed ‘Citigo’, aimed at facilitating life transitions by creating a streamlined and integrated lifestyle transition platform. The platform would anticipate possible queries and concerns addressed with added services and help people create a holistic road map for their future. It would retain users by including a robust community forum that would encourage them to come back even after they transitioned to their next life stage. We explained our framework, the pros and cons, and provided several mockups to demonstrate our product. We had one week to develop our response, after which we presented our findings to a panel of Citi Ventures employees.
